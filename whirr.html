              Whirr is an American shoegaze band from San Francisco, California,
              United States. They formed in 2010, originally as Whirl. The name
              was created by the original drummer, Sergio Miranda, in the midst
              of recording the band's first demos as a nameless project. It was
              a homage to all the bands of "the Scene That Celebrates Itself”
              (Lush, Ride, Moose, Medicine, Lilys, etc.). They had to legally
              change the name after a woman performing acoustic covers of Black
              Sabbath songs trademarked "Whirl" and threatened a lawsuit.
              <br />
              <br />
              Whirr's sound is often compared to My Bloody Valentine and
              Slowdive. Founding guitarist Nick Bassett also played in the band
              Deafheaven surrounding and including the release of their 2011
              album, Roads to Judah.
              <br />
              <br />
              After a self-released demo cassette and the Distressor EP, the
              band signed to Tee Pee Records in 2011. The original vocalist
              Byanca Munoz left the band because of creative differences, and
              was soon replaced by Alexandra Morte (Night School, Camera Shy).
              They released the June single that year, followed by their 2012
              debut album Pipe Dreams. The band also released two splits in 2012
              with Anne and Monster Movie.

            In 2013, the original drummer Sergio Miranda left the band and was
            replaced by Devin Nunes. Former vocalist Alexandra Morte also left
            the band and was replaced by Kristina Esfandiari (Miserable, King
            Woman). The band released a live EP entitled Part Time Punks
            Sessions on April 20, 2013. It was a performance recorded in 2012
            that featured the band’s previous lineup.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whirr released the Around EP on July 9, 2013, featuring the new
            vocalist along with session drummer Trevor DeSchryver (Lycus,
            Dispirit, formerly Deafheaven). They toured to support it that
            August with the band Nothing. Esfandiari was fired from the band
            prior to the tour, leaving the band without a female vocalist for
            the first time.
